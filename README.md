- âš¡ Fun fact:
Weaving has a remarkable mathematical connection! The binary pattern used in weaving (over-under) is essentially the same system that's used in computer programming. In fact, the Jacquard loom, invented in 1804, used punched cards to automatically control the weaving of complex patterns - a system that directly inspired early computer programming. Charles Babbage and later Herman Hollerith adopted this punched card approach for data processing, making the Jacquard loom a genuine predecessor to modern computers. This connection between textile art and computing shows how deeply mathematical thinking is woven into human creativity across different fields!
